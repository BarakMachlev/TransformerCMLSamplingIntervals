# TransformerCMLSamplingProtocols
A python toolbox based on PyTorch which utilized neural network for rain estimation and classification from commercial microwave link (CMLs) data. This toolbox provides an implementation of algorithms for extracting rain-rate using neural networks and CMLs.

This project is an extended version of the [PyNNcml](https://github.com/haihabi/PyNNcml) rainfall estimation toolbox, developed as part of the M.Sc. thesis of Hai Victor Habi under the supervision of Prof. Hagit Messer at Tel Aviv University and maintained by the [Cellular Environmental Monitoring and Processing Lab](https://cellenmonlab.tau.ac.il/).  

This version includes new features and experiments as part of the M.Sc. thesis of Barak Machlev under the supervision of Dr. Jonatan Ostrometzky, which focuses on the impact of sampling interval on rainfall estimation from CMLs using Transformers.

# PyNNcml Features

## Task and Algorithms

1. Wet Dry Classification (RNN[1,2,3] and STD Window[6])
2. Rain Estimation (Constant Baseline [6], Dynamic Baseline [5], Direct RNN Estimation [4,3])
3. Rain Field Interpolation (IDW, GMZ [9])
4. Wet Dry Classification and Rain Rate Estimation (Encoder-only Transformer)


## Datasets
This repository uses the PyTorch version of the OpenMRG dataset [10] and the synthesized datasets generated as part of Barak Machlev’s M.Sc. study, described in detail in the study and used for evaluating the impact of sampling interval on rainfall estimation.

# Impact of Sampling Interval on Rainfall Estimation from Communication Microwave Links Using Transformers

This repository includes all code required to train and reproduce the experiments for  
**Impact of Sampling Interval on Rainfall Estimation from Communication Microwave Links Using Transformers**.

The code and is in  
[`impact of sampling interval on rainfall estimation from communication microwave links using Transformers`](./impact%20of%20sampling%20interval%20on%20rainfall%20estimation%20from%20communication%20microwave%20links%20using%20Transformers)  
and includes:

1. **test_encoder_only_transformer.py** — train and evaluate the Transformer model on the OpenMRG dataset.
2. **Synthetic_DataSet.py** — simulation to generate the synthesized datasets.
3. **test_Synthetic_DataDet.py** — train and evaluate the Transformer model on the synthesized datasets.

## Model Zoo *(not relevant to this study)*
In this project we supply a set of trained networks in our [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haihabi/PyNNcml/tree/master/pynncml/model_zoo), this networks are trained on our own dataset which is not publicly available.
The model contains three types of networks: Wet-dry classification network, one-step network (rain estimation only) and two-step network (rain estimation and wet-dry classification). Moreover, we have provided all of these networks with a various number of RNN cells (1, 2, 3). From more details about network structure and results see the publication list.
